you feel free to to turn your camera off if you don't want to appear in the recording and again we will not make this public we will only share it with people within these degree programs who want to see what's going on so first of all huge thanks to everyone who's who has come in this meeting and thank you especially to our participants on the on the panel we have created the session because many students in the program and even made even faculty have questions about the Capstone thesis process and so we wanted to create this panel to highlight some examples of faculty and students who have worked together and so we're going to we have a really wonderful set of panelists joining us today and I just like to say take a second and introduce them first of all I'm going to kind of introduce them first I'll introduce the faculty we have Morris mail who is a faculty member in the program and Lisa rode also a faculty member in the program and then we have the students that they worked with Anthony wheeler Sabina Pringle and Lauren keho who and it's really amazing to see to have our graduates here and you know all of you since we're still in the program you can look and you can see these are these are students who did it they got through and they finish the program and they completed amazing projects and we're so excited to welcome them back today we're also really delighted and grateful to have Stevens scholarship library of deposit and especially around digital projects how how we kind of handle those so I'm just at the very beginning I'm just going to say a couple of girl words about the pieces Capstone process and try and answer a couple of the questions that we received in advance of the session then I'd like to introduce the our advisor advises in Paris to kind of talk a little bit about their their process and then we can take questions and answers from you what we can take questions from you and hopefully provide answers and just have a conversation so first of all one thing that is important to say is that the thesis and Capstone is required part of both the ma and DH and the MS data analysis degree programs it is as the word Capstone suggests it's kind of the the culminating Act of your degree program is putting together a final project and submitting it in the past most students working in master's degree programs would create a thesis which was a 50 to 60 kind of research-based argument and was all written out it was all it was mostly text and it was you know deposited to the library on paper for a long time we've now moved into a new area and I think these two degree programs are ones that were many students are thinking even more about doing cap stones and I think many of you are wondering well what's the difference between a Capstone and a thesis of the Capstone and how what do we have to do and has that work so I'd like to just try to answer a couple of those questions first of all though one example is a 50 to 60 page research paper and another one is a digital project we we imagine both one way of sort of scoping both of those kinds of projects is is the time that one takes to do them we imagine these as one semester projects other words these these projects shouldn't be something that you imagine taking place over the space of a year or three or four semesters it's something that you should try and begin and complete within the scope of a single semester and that that kind of temporal limitation may suggest to you some things that that may wind up limiting your project maybe you've got dreams of creating something much bigger but maybe for the purposes of the cast under thesis you want to start with some smaller more defined part of it in terms of the nature of like what could be a Capstone and what has to be submitted they're generally two parts to the Capstone submission one is the the Capstone digital project itself and you know the argument really is that that is your your your Capstone project the the actual digital project itself but we do ask for a written component which is a report where you about a 20 Page where you talk a little bit about the process of creating the Capstone project where you you try and put it in the context of the classes you've taken in the program and you document it a little bit you talk about your process and this is in in the tradition of what it would have been called white papers and like the scientific Community where you're sort of trying to document the process of creating something in terms of what can actually count as a as a Capstone project there's a lot of a lot of freedom in there and you know it's the the term is intentionally left capacious and vague so that students and their advisors can work out between them what they consider to be a reasonable Capstone project so you know we have seen students for instance create websites do data analysis and visualization and all of those things can can work and they're just different ways of putting together so it it may be a little bit frustrating to hear that there's no kind of single definition of what a Capstone can and should be or what's acceptable as a Capstone but in a lot of ways the answer is that you first of all put together a proposal for what the Capstone will be and then get some feedback from your advisor and from the program and then you kind of work it out with your advisor what it will be the process generally is that you it usually the Capstone is taken in your last semester in the program there are cases where you may want to take it earlier but we kind of discourage that it's really meant to be something that you're doing at the end of your experience with us so it is actually a class that you register for through the system it's a three credit class it's the last three credits and it's not actually necessarily a class you attend it's a way of kind of giving credit to your thesis advisor your Capstone advisor and it just sort of registers in the system that you're doing this this project as I said there is a kind of there is a proposal that you fill out to describe what you what you will be doing and then there's a submission process that Steven can talk more about where what you're trying to do is to Archive the and submit the the scholarly project I want to take one moment we are recording this session not for public distribution but only for students in the in our programs unable to attend this session and we will share the recording with them on an individual basis but if you don't want to be part of the recording you can turn your camera please privately I would recommend direct messaging using the chat to direct message Jason who can hear the questions on your behalf so the one thing to to be sure to do is to check the the library deadlines in the program deadlines for deposit because those kind of that kind of determines that the dates by which one has to do things I mean if you are it all depends on the degree dates and we kind of work backwards from there so if you are hoping to graduate in May with it with a with a May degree that means that you're the entire project needs to be submitted to the library I believe I may first but it before their multiple steps of approval first it has to be approved by your advisor and then it comes to the department and the and the director of the program in this case me has to read over and approve the project as well so that's why we ask for the project to be submitted to the program about 2 weeks before the library due date so what that means in practice if you think about the timeline if you're registering for the Capstone class in the spring you're starting at the very end of January like January 26th or something like that but then you've really got to finish the project by you know April 15th so there's really not all that much time but it's something to keep in mind there are lots of different options and ways to be flexible about this for instance if you are unable if you were doing it in the spring and you're unable to finish by you know the the deadlines you can continue to work on the project through the summer and then submit your project by the end of the summer and then graduate within October degree without having to pay tuition again or anything so there are ways to kind of extend the time a little bit if you if you need to in terms of who can advise Capstone projects it has to be a faculty member in the program so what you should do is look at when you're thinking about an advisor what I typically recommend that students do is to think about the The Faculty have had in class think about faculty who have responded to your projects faculty you've learned a lot from and approach them and ask them whether they would be willing to advise your your Capstone project there are some cases where it may make sense where you know you absolutely need someone outside of the program and that those are cases we make consider on a one on a Case by case basis so that's the kind of General overview of these Capstone projects we also I will share there's a there's a link on CUNY academic Works which is cuny's institutional repository there are links to two there a couple different things one is there are there's a link to our program specifically so students who have submitted for these direct degrees but there are also because we used to be tracks within the mouse program there are a number of suits to completed digital projects under that degree program there are projects listed there in a in an area called digital dissertations and feces so I will share those links with you as we go on today or in a follow-up after this and one final note is that the program is in the process of preparing a kind of more robust page on its website about all of this to kind of answer questions and provide documents Etc before I move on Jason is there anything that you want to add that no I think that about covers that I would just say that you know if somebody's if students are thinking about it for for the spring be in contact for the next couple months so as you said we can start to sort of work plan backwards but that's okay thank you so much what I think I'd like to do now what's let's start with our students maybe we'll we'll start with with one student and then ask that students advisor to speak and then just just go through so maybe Anthony can we can we start with you you know I think we've we've shared some some questions with you ahead of time to think through you know what was your process of picking a topic how did the whole thing work with challenges did you encounter along the way how did you find it advisor anything that you can and just maybe tell us like really briefly about your project as well there's a lot to work with here cuz my project technically was born in my first semester in the program that can fall 2018 there was very much a long haul and evolved many times throughout the couple years and it's still evolving so my project was a interactive scheme focus is a commentary and Haitian curriculum relationships between professors and students and students and students and just the way in which we value identity in the classroom and eventually down the line I implemented it and my English 1101 class and city tax and my students made games as an alternative form the writing and it was really great in terms of how it was born if I'm being completely honest it was born and response to a game that my collaborator and I did not like at all so it was we were inspired by a game we have played in the class that we just were really not into and so we were like there has to be a better way to impressive way to improve interactivity in game-based learning and so that's what we did we got together we made the game we made a Bare Bones project and presented it in our ICP program and eventually run it at the unicams conference and which is how I met Mora and yeah eventually there were challenges throughout the process eventually my collaborator had to take a semester off so we became a one from a few people project to a solo project which was a unique experience and yeah any challenges you ran into along the way any advice you would have for students who are thinking who are getting ready to think about their projects so yeah challenges was the transitioning from two people to one person cuz we had planned be projected to do the project under the impression that the workload would be split between two people but I'm not being the case so there was a lot of pulling back reevaluating my goals and we jiggering it based on what I could accomplish so low sounds of Challenge and something you might run into inner bearcase when it comes to collaboration it's definitely unique experience but definitely it doesn't not happen and that's very common in digital projects in general very much something that will come up when it comes to collaborating as far as advice in terms of planning your project do something you care about it's something you're passionate about something that I did something that's directly impacted me in my life so it kind of like you said it's fuel to generate something something good I like it and it's still going so I think it's really focus on something that you think there's a need for I think that's all I can say thank you so much and you want to say sure so I also teach ITP the interactive technology and pedagogy program and that's where you know all the faculty who teach in that program attend the final presentations in court too which is the class where which is the course where students are developing projects that they'll then elaborate on in the independent study so that was when I started working with Anthony it was as part of the his work in the ITP program so it made sense for us to continue with the Capstone and I would say that also I advise Lauren and it was sort of a similar trajectory so certainly it seems at least for folks who've gone through the ITP program that that's often a really useful way to start thinking about the Capstone project because this is a project that you maybe have had time to think about you know as the as the process gone went along definitely you know Anthony alluded to one of the challenges can be scope creep and Matt has also already eluded to this at the beginning right we often have a really en an elaborate idea and thinking about how to scale that down to something that can be completed in one semester I think is a challenge for everyone we talk about it a lot in the ITP program and we've talked about it in the Capstone that I have advised to so don't don't be discouraged but also it's not unusual you know expect that your advisor will say to you that could maybe be phase two like let's focus on phase one what we can accomplish here in the in the first semester in the one semester but yeah I think what else should I say any other questions I guess I would say overall you know sort of general advice communication is really important so once you've started working with an advisor you know I know that this is this is probably very obvious but you know setting up a schedule of communication I think has been important no it was you know in in the before times we did have in-person meetings you know in specifically with Anthony it was very easy for us to schedule in person needs because he was also teaching at City Tech but you know work something out with your advisor for sure and I think that because it does that one semester will go faster than you think it will right and even just coming back you know doing that math backwards from when things have to go to the library so really setting up a schedule and checking in frequently I think is really important to kind of keeping to keeping on track thank you so we're going to we're going to go through all the the students and faculty but we'll definitely have time to come back and ask questions sure thank you so so I worked collaboratively as well and what similarly to Anthony and I was able to maintain that partnership throughout the duration and so I worked on the union catalog which is a union catalog for identifying Zine collections throughout the world and I was also fortunate enough to kind of meet my partner pretty early on in my in the miles program and worked with Lisa in our intro to DH class and kind of was fostered and and steered through developing that project again pretty much from the first semester I was at the GC and then through ITP was able to continue to iterate on the the collaborative project and really it was an amazing to be able to sustain that project throughout the duration of the time I was at the GC and then again work collaboratively with my with my partner Jenna Friedman who's a librarian at Barnard Barnard and so so you know some of the unique challenges I guess or you know we weren't always on the same time schedule I think did my independent study at one point and Jenna was doing her independent study in another point and then also to tomorrow's point about communication and before times in person meetings you know there'd be times we'd all need to be in the same place in the same space that wasn't always possible so yeah just being really intentional about like an open communication and kind of knowing that there will be moments when you know something will have to move forward and they'll be something else that might have to be altered and so yeah and just one last thing about the scope group with this project was always kind of this idea you know there's there's thousands of individuals and we were dealing with you know kind of massive amounts of metadata records and it was always really really helpful to kind of have that reminder to you know continue to think through your project and in parts and to you know kind of try and down in that way so there's anything I can do to encourage everybody to think about their project in parts and try and move through it in that way thanks in the class you took with Lisa was that it was the second semester of the practice class it was the introduction to DH class so a project that kind of started out with a larger group of collaborators and then you and Jenna sort of you know did it as your as your Capstone were there any complications as far as you mean for moving from more team members down to me and I'm actually just going to pause my video I think I froze for a second sorry I'm going to go off video but you were saying in regards to more project Partners down to just two people I think you definitely definitely challenging right the more people that are available to do more things you know it's sometimes maybe easier to take on more of a project but Jenna and I you know kind of do work really well together and I think we were always kind of open with each other about kind of what our capacities were and also if we didn't have capacity cuz they were more team members in the in the past and we would be able to perhaps look to our Network and I should say that this project is exist beyond the GC as well right there's other there's other folks out there and non-gc land that are part of this project too and so you know we were able to you know identify kind of people that we could potentially work with we're working with but it was again maybe to the point that it was a challenge to kind of shift from having more people in the project to just Jenna and I but that just allowed us to perhaps think through you know who else we could work with and what other kind of strengths we needed to development to carry the project so much I'd like to turn out to Lisa I'd like to ask you to think talk to us about all the questions we've been asking about you know working with students advice you have but I also want to point out that with this project there were there were some really distinct components first you were you Lauren and Jenna were doing the first collaborative project we've had and they also did a their their white paper was a or process paper was the scene so I was wondering if you could through the complications and possibilities that you saw while you were advising this project so I think to go back to the idea of the Capstone right the Capstone in a building is is not just the thing that's on top but it's the thing that brings the structure together to complete it and so I think that that sort of metaphor works for what Lauren and Jenna did with their Zine project where they really were thinking about each of the parts of their course selections as really starting I kind of builds this structure and the Capstone was pulling all of those disparate courses together into a kind of narrative that they could tell about what the benefits were of having done this program that you know the the name for which might not convey necessarily to an employer or to other other people and so if you think about this activity as being really the culminating also argument about why all of the work that you've done is valuable in a professional context that it that it helps you to craft the narrative and so one thing that I would I would recommend cuz I know there was just so much there's a lot of meta work that was going on for Lauren and for Jenna and they are incredibly well organized and thoughtful about how they were going to pull that together so one advice that I would have is even if you are not thinking about working on a project that's explicitly out of ass that you were taking that you should be thinking about your Capstone culminating project from the first semester that you get here and one of the recommendations that I've made to to Mouse students for example for capstone's is to actually begin a journaling project where at the beginning of every semester you're talking about what are the courses that you're taking what are the expectations what are your personal goals for that for that semester to kind of revisit that writing somewhere in the middle and then as you're choosing your courses for the next semester to think about how you either decided to change tax because actually you're interested in something else or whether you've decided to take something that will help you push a project or an interest idea further and keeping kind of track of your own personal path through the degree program can also help you to really think about how you're going to articulate the sort of overall experience and I recommend that you you know you'll hear that we've worked with the students in this in each of these circumstances prior to getting to their Capstone and I know that that can sometimes be challenging so my recommendation would be get very comfortable with setting up meetings with faculty even if you don't have a pre-established agenda for that meeting faculty really do want to talk to you a casual conversation is a great thing to have for a half an hour during a day packed with meetings where you just talking to a student about their work that's a great like from for many of the other kinds of things that we do all day long and so we like to hear about what you're doing and so what I would recommend is that you just get used to setting up at least one one-on-one meeting with every faculty member that you're taking a class from just so that you can get a feel for how you communicate with one another how you work with one another faculty have different you know kinds of we have personalities and we have ways that we work and and sometimes those play well together and sometimes they don't and you may find somebody who is wonderful in terms of exactly the project that you want to work on but maybe you you're you know just in terms of how you think about things you know you need lots of feedback and there you know not able to give you feedback every week or something like that you want to think about those intangible parts of the project because in the end the best advisor is the advisor that you work with well and everybody is enthusiastic about working with students they're all here because they really are committed to that idea so give yourself the opportunity to feel out your relationship with people feel comfortable about walking in and if you don't feel comfortable setting up an appointment with the faculty member but you want that faculty member to be the person who is advising your project think about what kinds of things support network you're going to have to set up for yourself to make sure that you're constantly able to keep that communication so so those those are some things I think about you know if you are thinking about working with an advisor when you do get to proposing your project you'll want to think about what you're learning style is about your mode of working and sort of how you think you see yourself going to project and being able to articulate that expectation to your advisor so they know how to best to support you throughout it sometimes we we don't know whether or not you want emails on a regular basis asking how things are or you know if you really just want to be on your own for a long time and this is part I think about moving from an undergraduate setting to a graduate setting is that our relationship is different and we're going to take signals from you and cues from you because as an adult you are now in a position where you can structure your learning environment with more purpose and we can take signals to better support you say things like you know who being able to know whether or not you want lots of feedback or just a little bit of feedback when you approach your faculty member I would say that you it would be a good idea to sorry I have notes down here that I'm trying to catch up with now that you have a short project description so I would say definitely make sure that you've gone and read all of the documentation about the project not every faculty member is going to have that memorized and so you know they may be sort of scrambling to remember what all of the steps of the process are so you should come into that process fully informed about the steps the dates the deadlines to kind of help structure the process it is it is your project in the end and we're going to take her keys like they keep saying from you that I would say be ready to say a couple sentences about why you want to work with that faculty member a lot of times they'll be trying to figure out how they fit into the project that you're doing so being able to say you know I want to work with you because we had that that course in feminist text analysis and I really want to do text analysis on this particular thing and something something just a a sentence or two it doesn't have to be a whole lot and it's also very helpful for them to know what your expectations are for yourself with that project Beyond completion so I'm working on this project because I would like to get to go on to a PhD program I'm working on this project because I'm really interested in applying for a new job in this field you know what is the the sort of the end goal of that and that will help your advisor to really think about you know well what are really the goals that you need to have in mind what is it that you want to be able to put on display and they can help you sort of craft that scope and as a graduate student like this is something that Lauren and Jenna became very comfortable with over the semester and something I say regularly to folks you set the terms upon which you would like your project to be evaluated and that is another growth moment for you as a graduate student in an undergraduate sequence there's a lot of boxes to take and lots of things that we have to check off and say that you've done this master's program is very different allows you with a lot of flexibility and I think that that you are in the in a position to being able to use that to your advantage to say you know as you're writing your proposal I expect for my project to be able to do these things and your advisor will take that in cue you know we're here to work with you nobody really wants to be in a role where we're just like correcting your work and sending it back we want this to be a discussion in the collaboration to help you move into spaces that you would really like to be you know advised on and and I would just say that that you should at the very outset no that project plan is going to change and you know all of those skills that you've accumulated through the ITP core one and two that you've accumulated through the introduction to digital practice that's exactly the structure that we've used to create the documentation for this project so you know you iterating over the process that you have done several times by this point so it should feel fairly comfortable and that's you know that's really the majority of it is just really thinking about you know that the process of creating your your work plan about being flexible enough to know that it may change and that that all you need to really do with your advisor is explain why that change makes sense and that's why you know when you're setting the terms of the the way in which your Project's going to be evaluated when you say well I've decided to Pivot here and finish my project to do it with you know this in mind it's because I want to be you know evaluated thinking about this audience right maybe it's it's really audience driven and that's the last thing I would say is make sure that your project has a really good sense of who the audience is whether it's a you know another group of academics whether it's a public engagement and audience can be an opportunity for you to create a system of support are they people you know are they people who could look at giraffes who could be included in sort of the evaluation of your project those are real opportunities that you have I think in this program and through the Capstone that that you don't don't always have so that's my this my little should be there thank you so much that was great and I was going to ask you as a follow-up to ask answer some questions but you end up answering them so that's wonderful thank you let's turn out to Sabina or our last student can you talk a little bit about your project how it developed how I think you dealt with some of those issues of kind of the the project changing and needing to be flexible can you just talk a little bit about your processity 2018 and my thesis explains why it is important that incarcerated students be able to learn digital skills and digital Humanities and so yes so you know the idea for my for my project was born in that insurance DH class but also came from what I was seeing I found myself in the digital Humanities program where we were learning all this wonderful stuff at the same time I was tutoring in federal prison in Brooklyn I was tutoring incarcerated students who were preparing to pass the GED and I was struck by the lack of digital Technologies of course there was a lot of many of the conversations were about what digital Humanities is what humans is supposed to do and there were you know these two worlds so it seemed a great idea to build of course to be taught in prison this just I mean it just seemed really clear so so now that project you know I kind of dragged it along with me for years my advice was Matt he was so patient it was I mean he helped me find my way in this you know really massive I really didn't know how to approach it at first but in the practice course in the second semester I learned a lot of tools for how to you know build a project I must say that I was devastated that my project was not chosen as the projects to be developed I realized that maybe it was because I wasn't articulating it clearly enough then the other courses they were serious of other questions which really really software design lab with Patrick Smith where I discovered well yeah I really discovered Computing there how it works and that was the solution this is how to do it the digital Humanities can be told because there's no internet in prison so it should be taught with you know using mineral Computing methods and all this time conversations with Matt I met with Matt I think every two weeks sometimes only for 15 minutes or even yeah we had longer meetings you know figuring out where I was going how to incorporate all of this exciting new knowledge that I was learning so yeah this is how we do it and then the digital Research Institute was also I mean totally super influential super awesome the digital fellows were an amazing resource for me I would just go and hang out in office hours but you know I would get there and I'd be like well my question is not really very clear so let me just sit here and try and figure out what I'm trying to figure out and they were like really helpful really patient so that was so all of these things came together and I created this course to be taught in prison now just just to tell you where the where the project is at now is so now so after now now I'm in a group of so I'm at CUNY School of Law after The Graduate Center I I was admitted to Community School of Law where I'm studying public interest law and we are just starting a student Group which is a student group called Equitable ethical and Equitable technology eat and so this is there we are maybe approaching it you know we're interested in many many different there it is there it is being talked about and hopefully will become a real thing so I'm so any other any is there anything I should say that I didn't no I think that's I think that's great but just to reiterate that you did both the thesis and the Capstone so you had this sort of digital project on GitHub I think right that you where you lay out the curriculum and you sort of explain it I think right yeah yeah and and the interesting things that I used a lot of resources that have been developed by digital photos these these build and we could be adopted for working with minimal Computing in an environment where there was no connection to the Internet so that was yeah thank you so much thank you I just wanted to say that I realized this is for both parents for the digital Humanities program and the date of his program I apologize that our examples are from the DH program we we don't yet have graduates from the data analysis with this program so those of you who are here from that program will be among our first and just to note that there there are there are some examples of data this projects that have come out of the liberal studies program but that was there from you know the time when there wasn't as much coursework in data analysis although they can give you some inkling of what's possible they're not going to be you know we we think your projects being a little bit different but what I also want to do is work I'd like to ask Steven's wible to about deposit depositing projects preservation sustainability and I also want to encourage all of you who for whom questions have come up to start putting them into the chat because we will maybe have about 5 to 10 minutes to start addressing them Steven hi yes I'll try to go quickly so that there's some time for questions but I am your liaison Library some of the elements of depositing a Capstone especially a digital Capstone to the library quickly Library and deposit simply means adding the work to the library's collection so that it can be made available to researchers and that may be somewhat counterintuitive or a peer counterintuitive for especially Web projects or other digital projects which are already being made available right online or something like that but part of it is about capturing the work as a stable object and making it maybe more transparent in some ways and documenting it in ways that are helpful for finding and Recreation and things like that so to help to do this the library has guidelines designed to prepare your research for an audience outside of your advisor and we also are looking ahead we in terms of sustainability to the person 10 or 20 years from now who may wish to consult your work so we have a few things that I want to paste into the chat we let me just really quickly this okay and now I've lost another okay so what I posted in here is that we have these live guides research guides that are a discussion of the steps required to deposit as well as deadlines and graduation dates and then also so the digital deposits collection as examples for the various digitals that have been put into the library already to go through a really quick like timeline that you might expect to experience that at some point a student reviews the digital project information that we have on another link that I'm going to put here as well we that is myself and Roxann shirazi who is the dissertation research have come up with some format requirements for your paper your white paper portion of your Capstone which is things like an abstract a digital manifest a list of variables of applicable it's sort of analogous to like a table of contents and an appendix in another kind of document like that and these are there in order to help sustainability and goals of transparency and understanding of what your project is like and I hope these might sound like extra or additional burdens but they're really not too much additional work and I think they can help clarify what the form of the work can be when we've seen students follow the rules before it has had some positive impacts so they will students will review this information and of course you're always welcome and encouraged in fact it's going to contact with me the early side of your coming bringing together your Capstone to discuss just like feasibility and I can be another you know wall to bounce ideas off of as well as sustainability and questions of capturing your work and putting it into the library in in that format so you would then prepare documentation for instance the white paper or otherwise the advisor or program and program improve the Capstone and email the library with their approval the student creates an author account on academic Works fills out a submission form and attaches documentation and then Roxanne colleague the district dissertation research library and will review submission and email you with any corrections that are necessary and written repeat until that's done and then the library notifies the registrar that the deposit is complete so the most important thing to notice that the digital components take time to troubleshoot and verify so please plan ahead the documentation must be submitted before the deadline in order to fulfill the degree requirement and we will continue to troubleshoot any issues on capturing digital piece as need to be on that so it's not about it's really just about the documentation in terms of a deadline any kind of capturing or putting into the depositing it actually can be done you know we're not going to prevent you from graduating in order to do that does that make sense okay so that's my quick Spiel and thank you thank you so much do we have any does anyone emissions help but I was wondering Sabina about the your choice to make a to do a thesis and a Capstone and I wonder if you could talk a bit about why you needed both components and maybe even the order of which maybe you started knowing that you needed both but particularly I was kind of wondering since the digital project like the Capstone project component comes with a white paper why then a thesis like what did you need to do or choose to do in the thesis component of this hybrid sort of project that you couldn't have done just in the white paper alone yes so Captain the chat as I was I was answering that way but I'm happy to tell you it started out I really wanted to build something I really that was that was that was the first thing I wanted to see was I wanted to build this thing I saw this thing I visualized it I wanted to I wanted to build rather than right but when it I think it was the focus on really so the thesis contains components of a white paper and that it explains how how this how not so much how I built it that's actually in the documentation of the of the Capstone itself so this kind of a white paper white paper like thing in the Capstone project itself which is the documentation because I was and I am hoping that this is something that can be taken further and can be a proposal could be turned into a proposal so I thought that it was important to make an argument that really looked at why this why there was this absence of digital learning in prisons and what what this is in a larger to be and I think we just lost your audio for this project in a larger context of why these why these people are being treated unequally why they're being excluded from so much so many opportunities and possibilities that digital skills give them and also even within a college in prison context why it's necessary that digital Humanities we taught in prison alongside lots of other Humanities courses I'm so basically answer your Michael it's really helpful yes thank you and I would just say that you know my memory may very well be imperfect but I kind of remember you came with the idea of like it was a it was about creating this like curriculum and website and then you you started just wanting to like scope out the argument and writing it out and ask that kind of grew and as you're thinking developed you started thinking like I just want to get this argument out there and then we started to facing the issue of like time and you know it became like well you know you're writing what's basically a thesis but you really also want to do something that's like a digital project so like let's see let's let's focus on the thesis first and get that sort of into working shape and then see what kind of time you have left to to put together some kind of implementation or prototype of the thing you want to create are there are there any other questions out there I imagine I just had one quick follow-up to see Venus Project so then Sabina actually did the Capstone the thesis plus she built digital the Capstone is the thing built so in other words thanks sorry yeah so since the majority of example belongs to digital Humanities so I am wondering if the Capstone of data analysis will be a little different than the digital Humanities I know that we need to make a research a lot of statistics and interpretation for the prediction analysis focus more on software analysis prediction than the writing that's a great question period thank you for that you know I linked I linked to one example in the in the Lancaster shared I I link to an example project of data analysis and visualization database crowdsource database Jeopardy that he had found and I shared that as an example of like what a more data is like paps on might look like I would say a couple things first as I mentioned before we don't have any graduates yet so we don't have it we we have a couple of students who are working on their capstones right now in the date of his program but they're they're pretty early on so it's a little hard to sort of say where things we will we will to say you know give you better examples but I would say that there are no hard and fast rules about what the Capstone must contain so I think you know I don't think you should necessarily feel like your Capstone has to contain all of the elements you've you've just described you know I I think it really depends on what area of the date of his program you're focusing on I could imagine a Capstone project that's purely like data analysis and statistical in nature and that doesn't include much visualization creating something that is very much about interactive date of it so you know there I think there's a pretty wide amount of latitude which you know I know can also be frustrating to not have like sort of Define boundaries I think especially what one way to think about this Capstone sort of building on what Lisa said earlier about the you know this being the kind of culminating moment is often I would say it depends on what you kind of want to do with your with your degree afterwards so for instance if you are if you imagine yourself going on the job market and trying to find a job you'll want to produce a Capstone that you could really show the perspective employers as an example of what you've you've learned and something that you know will really kind of show that off where it's like if you want to go into it another graduate degree program for instance you might be less interesting entirely so it really kind of depends on on your situation in terms of your own interest in the conversation Matthew if I could just add the way people are for example does request a section on methodologies so there are there are quite a few components that parallel from the DH Capstone project and the the data analysis in data visualization you know if you think about this as that culmonary culminating activity of the data analysis and visualization project you should be able to articulate who your audience is you should be able to explain what methods it is that you've chosen and why you should be able to explain whether or not you're choosing a particular mode of visualization and why that's the most effective mode of of articulation for an audience is purpose so that framing work is still there thinking about why you made color selections or why you've decided to use a particular you know one statistical method over another statistical method you do have to have I believe in the in the description of your data and your data set so thinking about how you got all of that now some people which is that they want to because they are producing a website or something like that as a product that those are components that you're including in the Capstone and then the white paper is really more sort of an over arching sort of narrative of weaving those things together or maybe the the project you're doing is more kind of experimental and affective where you know it's it's trying to be playful where the white paper then needs to absorb a bit more of the intellectual Framing and articulation of why you've taken this slightly more experimental approach does that help absolutely thanks it's like my question was because I know for example my goal is to be that Analyst at the end so and to be in the job market so that's why if I'm thinking now it's like I'm thinking I'm thinking only about statistic and visualization and machine learning so that's why I cannot just like link the custom with my project that's why it's a little confusing especially like the first time what I'm doing that I mean one one I would imagine that the type that you would create like if you want to show something create something that showed off those things it would be basically what you would be creating as a digital Capstone would be like a website that shared your analysis you could describe to answer to answer Kelly's question about the Capstone course available in the summer it usually it is not so I would say which doesn't mean that you can't work on your Capstone over the summer what I what I would suggest is that if for instance you imagine yourself having to or needing to use this summer for your Capstone I would register for it in the spring and then with an understanding with your advisor that you'll be doing a fair amount of work over the summer now the one depending on your advisor they may or may not be available for all or for certain parts of the summer so that's really something to work out individually any other questions I mean one one question that I get often is you know how do I find an advisor and you know I would say I really do think it's worthwhile to like spend some time thinking about people you've taken classes with I think you can always come and ask me if I have recommendations for you I'm always happy to like introduce you to people if needed and you know if you're really stuck I think it's really important to just like get in touch sooner rather than later so that we can we can help you sorry Michael look like you were maybe going to ask a question I had one more but it was actually for Anthony but I wonder if Laura maybe you could speak to it to some degree to whatever degree makes sense and in your capacities having advised him but you might have some sense of this too but I'm just wondering what kinds of I wanted to know from Anthony whether he approached the thesis and Capstone component of the ma degree with any eye toward the PHD program that he's now in and I kind of just wonder if there are tips in general from faculty advisors working with folks who may have an eye on PhD applications and dissertation research whether there are tips you have for us for Anthony as you think through a project how to kind of tee things up for applications and in further research so you may or may not be able to have anything to say about that but I just thought I'd picture anyway yeah so you know Anthony and I didn't talk about it I don't know that I don't know whether this that was his intent at the very beginning so again at the by the time the Capstone semester happened he had already been working on this project really for like three four semesters but definitely by the time he was doing the Capstone that was his intent and I I you know I I think I wrote one of his letters of recommendation for the PHD program and his project was really pedagogy Focus so that he discussed the game that he and his collaborator created and his Capstone project was both continuing to the develop the game using that game in the class that he taught at City Tech and writing a writing a pedagogical guide to others for others to use the game but also kind of unpacking what the responses have been you know it went when he played when he used that game in his teaching as well so it did you know it did set him up really well I think to apply to the program because it sort of put him on that trajectory where he was really thinking about about how to use the stuff that he had worked on in you know in his pedagogy as well I don't know Matt if you have anything to add yeah I mean I think like one thing to consider is just sort of think forward to the moment when one would be writing an application letter to a doctor or program and thinking about how the how the Capstone project is going to fit into that letter so you know obviously like for for Anthony like it was he's doing a pedagogical project he's he's on issues of diversity and higher education and then he's applying to a doctoral program in urban education that focuses on the same issue so there was a nice fit you know English program literature for instance but you should you should be thinking about whatever you do about how you might articulate that the goals and the subject of the current project and move that towards the the graduate program I'm saby and I wonder if you do you have anything to say about this in the sense that you know I can't remember I know it written your letter but I can't remember oh yeah no I absolutely I mean I did I did discuss it in my in my statement of application to CUNY law however that wasn't that that really wasn't a thought when I first started working on the project I think that at some point I you know I said yes this will this will look good but it wasn't really designed for that for that purpose well you know we are we're kind of out of time see people having to jump off so I I think we should bring this to a close but I want to invite you all if questions come up afterwards having watch this if you want to follow up on individually please feel free obviously to follow up with any of the I'm sure any of the presenters would be happening to happy to talk I'm sure Steve would be happy to meet with you I'm certainly happy to meet with you Jason I know has lots of thoughts as well so please you know I just want to write reiterate that this is a process that I think it can it can induce anxiety and the best way to kind of move past that is to just be in contact and be in touch with people to voice that and to help let us help you kind of work out any questions you may have so take care and please be in touch and it's great great to see you all bye everyone thank you very much to all of our panelists thank you thanks everyone
